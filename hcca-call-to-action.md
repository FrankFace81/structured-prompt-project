## **🧭 Call to Action: Help Improve the High-Conflict Co-Parent Communication Assistant (HCCA)**

**HCCA is a Creative Commons–licensed tool built to educate co-parents navigating high-conflict situations.**

This isn’t a commercial product—it’s a free, open-source tool for real-world use.

### **⚙️ How it Works:**

### **HCCA leverages AI-driven role-play** to reduce conflict and promote clear, constructive communication between co-parents. **Here's a quick breakdown** of how it works.

### **👤 Third-Person Messaging:**

* ### Uses roles like *Mother* and *Father* to frame replies.

* ### Reduces emotional heat by creating neutral, reviewable language.

### **🧱 Conflict Reduction Strategies:**

* ### Built-in B.I.F.F, J.A.D.E., and GREY ROCK logic.

* ### Keeps tone brief, informative, and emotionally non-reactive.

### **🧠 Contextual Input & Transparent Output:**

* ### You input a situation and message.

* AI explains its response logic via Concerns and Notes so you understand the “why”.

### **⚖️ Legal Role-Play**—Akin to mock trials

* ### Lets AI simulate perspectives of opposing counsel and judges.

* ### Helps stress-test tone and anticipate legal scrutiny.

* Unlocks Chess Mode: AI "plays chess" with your draft to balance perspectives.


### **🔁 Continuous Iteration:**

* ### Use *Refine*, *New Message*, or *Chess Mode* to adjust tone and logic

* Learn as you go through feedback loops

### **🧪 Real-World Validation**

**The core rules** contained in the prompt **were aggregated** **from Doctors, Lawyers, Software Engineers, Litigants, and others.** The only aspect I added was strict adherence to third person narrative using court defined parenting roles.

**I’ve used the principles behind this tool** in my own high-conflict co-parenting journey **since May 2024**. Within a handful of messages, **my ex began mirroring the third-person tone and structure.** 

**Conflict didn’t vanish—**I still deal with stonewalling, deflection, slow debt repayment, and referencing the parenting plan and/or legal statutes as needed. What changed was the **emotional volatility pretty much disappeared**. **I have saved myself an immense degree of time, energy and frustration** adhering to the methods contained in this structured prompt. That’s the win. That’s the shift.

This framework reflects what worked.

### **✅ Who I'm Looking For**

**I'm seeking contributors to help improve and expand a tool I've developed:** The goal is to help protect children from stress, and maintain healthy relationships with parents through education.

**HCCA’s core logic is sound**—rooted in real-world use and refined for an extended period of time. **The tool already works** via LLMs like ChatGPT, Claud Sonnet, and Gemini (Copilot has difficulty following HCCA’s rigid structure). For privacy I have been testing with DuckDuckGo ([duck.ai](http://duck.ai)) and experiencing good results.

**I am open to suggestions**, this is my first go at writing a structured prompt and I did it without training or referencing documentation, just pure passion, ideation and iteration.

**To reach more people and improve usability**, I’m looking for collaborators in the following areas:

* **Prompt Engineers** – To help modularize/refactor the prompt logic for flexibility and edge cases.

* **Therapists or Family Law Professionals** – For validation and insight on tone, clarity, and responsible usage.

* **UX Designers or Writers** – To simplify onboarding, especially those unfamiliar with AI tools.

* **Frontend Developers (Chat-Bot, Browser, Desktop, or Mobile App)** – To program the tool into accessible formats, reduce token count and strengthen its logic.

* **Open-Source Contributors** – If you're aligned with the mission and want to help shape a real-world impact project.

**If you’ve got ideas**, experience, or interest—especially in the intersection of AI, behavioral design, and real-world problem solving—**let’s talk.**

### **🔍 What I’m Asking:**

1. **Test the tool**: Checkout the [README](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1TuJPlvVgSrDnmW2O1yG9YohbkI3OAOAfoUzyOp_Zorg/edit) or jump right in [hcca-beta](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/15qEXbbVwgy8tarEyu2w7UbV3Hek0Jx0nQjs-iHtKq5Q/edit).

2. **Break it, stress test it, or simplify it** – I want failure modes and friction points.

3. **Suggest edits, refinements, or blind spots**

4. **(Optional)**: Join a small circle refining future iterations of this and related tools.
